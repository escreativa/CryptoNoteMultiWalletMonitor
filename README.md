CryptoNoteMultiWalletMonitor
============================

Monitors all of the Monero/ByteCoin/Other CryptoNote currency wallet files in a folder.

Features:
* View combined balance for all wallets.
* Send a command to one wallet or to all simultaneously.
* Optionally, transfer coins from one wallet to another (e.g. an exchange) whenever the wallet balance is over some threshold. (Note that the destination wallet must not be one of those in the folder being monitored.)
* Accepts a password for all wallets as a command line parameter, or will ask for it. (All wallets should have the same password.) Can also save the password, though this is not recommended.
* Fully customisable, either via the "set" command in the application, or via editing an XML document in C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Local\XDO_Software.

The easiest way to get started is to drop the .exe in the folder containing simplewallet.exe and your wallet files.
